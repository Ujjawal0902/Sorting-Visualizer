# Sorting Visualizer üìäüîç

## üöÄ Project Overview

This is an **interactive sorting visualizer** that demonstrates various sorting algorithms in action. The application allows users to:
- Select a sorting algorithm from a dropdown menu.
- Visualize the sorting process with dynamic bars representing array values.
- Listen to audio feedback for each sorting operation, enhancing the user experience.

The system implements three sorting algorithms: **Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort**, making it easy to compare their performance visually.

## üìö Features

- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose from Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, or Insertion Sort.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: See the array sorted in real-time with animated bars.
- **Audio Feedback**: Hear sounds corresponding to swaps and comparisons for an engaging experience.
- **Randomized Data Generation**: Initialize a new random array for each sorting session.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Implementation of sorting algorithms and animation logic.
